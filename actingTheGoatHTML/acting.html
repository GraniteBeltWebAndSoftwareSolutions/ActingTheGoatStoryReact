<h1>Acting The Goat</h1>
		<p>By Jason Flemming</p>
		<p>On a slightly rainy day I was travelling with a friend to pick up an old 
		TV. My TV had suddenly refused to turn on and I wasn't prepared to pay 
		for a brand new one. I heard talk that there was an old CRT or Cathode 
		Ray Tube TV in the shed of my friend's son. So off we went to rescue it 
		from the damp and from the dust of its present location.</p>
		<p>We took Mount Tully Road on the outskirts of Stanthorpe and along 
		the way we passed a farm. My friend pointed out a donkey and a couple 
		of goats. 'Those goats think that the donkey is their mother,' he said to 
		me. Suddenly my mind was cast back more than thirty years to my 
		childhood.</p>
		<p>When I first lived in the country, my family stayed at an old 
		abandoned farm. It was a lot of fun for a boy my age. I was about seven 
		or eight years old. The property was situated opposite a pine forest, 
		down the end of a very long road, and about five kilometres from my 
		Uncle and Aunts place. Often I would ride my push bike between 
		our house at the farm and my Aunty's place. That is until she moved 	
		away about two months afterwards. It hope it wasn't me that made 
		them move, I'd never really thought of it until now. But the main reason 
		they moved was because they couldn't make any money from farming. I 
		remember a story of how my Uncle had sent away his produce from the 
		crops and had received a few postage stamps for all his hard work. It 
		was quite a shock to my mum because it was my Aunt that had talked 
		her into leaving suburbia to live in the middle of nowhere. But it didn't 
		bother me as I loved living in the peace and quiet of the country.</p>
		<p>So there we were, a single mother of two boys, living with no 
		neighbours anywhere close. Although we had a phone, we didn't  have 
		electricity. We used gas for the old gas powered fridge, lights and as for 
		any other appliances we had to use battery. The stove we used was an 
		old wood fire. </p>
		<p>Some nights my family and I would think there was someone 
		walking around on the roof, and of course we would become rather 
		frightened. In the morning we would realise that it was probably just a 
		rather large and noisy possum. </p>
		<p>There were a lot of animals around that I had never seen before. At 
		least not in real life. Dingoes, kangaroos, wallabies, feral cats, wild 
		horses/brumbys, echidnas, snakes, the list could go on and on. But two 
		of the strangest animals weren't wild they were domesticated. These
		were a cow and goat that we were looking after. </p>
		<p>The goat would get into the house and jump all over the furniture, 
		causing chaos for us all. The cow would eat grass and go moo. The 
		strange part was that the cow was the mother of the goat. Not literally of 
		course. But the goat would be looked after by the cow as if it were the 
		mother. And that included milk straight from the cow's udders. I don't 
		know who arranged for this strange parenting and maybe today that's 
		quite common, especially with all this talk about gender and it suddenly 
		being not alright to classify a person as either male or female. But when 
		I were a lad I had never seen such a thing. I know nothing of what 
		happened to the goat or the cow afterwards. But I'm quite sure that had 	
		the goat been human it would have had an identity crisis or at least 
		some form of psychological problems. And to the end of its days was 
		probably eating grass, chewing the cud, and trying to go moo.</p>
